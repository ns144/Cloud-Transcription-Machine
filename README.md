# Cloud-Transcription-Machine

The core functionality of [Ton-Texter](https://ton-texter.de) is to transcribe audio and video files. Therefore we use models based on OpenAIs [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper). Additionally we perform a speaker diarization with [Pyannote](https://huggingface.co/pyannote). That way we can deliver state of the art transcription performance.

This repository represents the setup of our AWS Cloud infrastructure via Terraform. The following chart gives an overview over our complete application architecture:

We implemented the setup of our Auto Scaling group and our general AWS infrastructure in the Repository: [Cloud-Transcription-Service]([https://github.com/ns144/Cloud-Transcription-Machine](https://github.com/ns144/Cloud-Transcription-Service)). The transcription application that the EC2 uses for the transcription can be found in the Repository: [Transcription-Application](https://github.com/ns144/Transcription-Application). The related NEXT.js in the Repository: [Ton-Texter](https://github.com/hanneskoksch/ton-texter).

This repository is used to setup the Launch Template for our Auto Scaling group:
